There is quite interesting, widely-using and powerful theorem in a probability theory, you should already know something about:
it's Bayes theorem.

The formula for this theorem is quite simple, but I've got an idea of what it actually means just with a particular example.

Let's say we want to calculate the probability of meeting with a Big Foot in your yard.

| Description | Variable | Probability |
|-------------------|----|----|
| Independent probability of meeting a Big Foot | _x_ | 2% |
| New event: You've seen trace very similar to Big Foot |
| Probability of this event, if there was Big Foot in your yard | _y_ | 70% |
| Probability of this event, it there is no Big Foot here | _z_ | 30% |
| Posterior probability |
| Probability of meeting Big Foot in case you've seen the trace | x*y/(x*y + z(1-x)) | 1.27% |

So as you can see here, even if you fond some trace of Big Foot, it does not make the chance to meet him greater!

The trick is to think about _y_ and _z_ as independent variables, so in this case we should imagine both universes: where we have Big Foot, and where we don't.

In the first case, in the universe where BF happily lives we can say that he could leave his trace probably in 60% of cases. Other cases could be - he was in a shoes, or who knows what?
In the second case, in the universe where there is no BF creature at all, is it possible to him to leave a trace? Don't think so. But it's possible somehow to see his trace. For example you have a friend, who wants to make laught on you.

So event with a power of universe where BF exists, we can't say that seeing his trace make us more confident, that we can meet BF soon.
